## ⚙️ Relay & Motor Control (via GPIO)

Used to control motion via linear actuators (e.g., acceleration, braking):

| Relay   | GPIO Pin | Function          | State when LOW |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Relay 1 | GPIO 17  | Forward (Motor A) | Activated      |
| Relay 2 | GPIO 18  | Reverse (Motor A) | Activated      |
| Relay 3 | GPIO 22  | Forward (Motor B) | Activated      |
| Relay 4 | GPIO 23  | Reverse (Motor B) | Activated      |

> **Note:** All relays are initially set to `HIGH` (inactive) to prevent accidental motion during startup.

## 📷 PiCamera2 – Camera Feed

- **Connected via:** CSI Ribbon Cable to Raspberry Pi Camera Port
- **Configured using:** `picamera2` in Python
- **Video Resolution:** 1280x720 @ 30 FPS

---

## 🧠 Object Detection – YOLOv8

- **Library:** Ultralytics YOLO (`ultralytics`)
- **Classes Tracked:** `person`, `car`, `truck`, `motorcycle`, `bicycle`
- **Runs on:** CPU or GPU (if available)

## 🧲 Ultrasonic Sensor – Distance Detection

**Example: HC-SR04 (or compatible)**

| Pin  | Connected to |
| ---- | ------------ |
| VCC  | 5V           |
| GND  | GND          |
| TRIG | GPIO 5       |
| ECHO | GPIO 6       |

> Update the GPIO pins in the code if different from above.

## 📍 Optional: GPS Module (for Map Integration)

**Example: Neo-6M GPS**

| GPS Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin  |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| VCC     | 3.3V or 5V        |
| GND     | GND               |
| TX      | GPIO 15 (UART RX) |
| RX      | GPIO 14 (UART TX) |

> Don’t forget to enable UART via `raspi-config`.

## 🧾 Summary Block Diagram (Text Format)

```
          +----------------------+
          |     Raspberry Pi     |
          +----------------------+
                  | | | |
                  | | | +---> Relay 1-4 (GPIO 17,18,22,23)
                  | | +-----> Ultrasonic (TRIG/ECHO)
                  | +-------> PiCamera2 (CSI)
                  +---------> GPS (UART, optional)

          Relays → Actuators
          PiCamera2 → Object Detection (YOLO)
          Ultrasonic → Distance Monitoring
          GPS → Map Feed (Google Maps API)
```

## ✅ Tips

- Always use a **separate power supply** for actuators/relays to avoid damaging the Pi.
- Use a **logic-level shifter** or transistor if the sensor operates at 5V logic.
- GPIO pins should be **cleaned up with `GPIO.cleanup()`** when the app stops.
